*easy-quoteplus*  Easier access to |quoteplus|

INTRODUCTION                                    *easy-quoteplus*

Vim's |quoteplus| register, which stores the contents of the system clipboard,
is somewhat tedious to access by default. As a result there have been various
approaches to make access easier:

  * CUA keybindings with, e.g. |mswin.vim|
  * |clipboard-unnamedplus| to make |quoteplus| the default register for yank,
    delete, change, and put commands
  * Various |<Leader>| mappings
  * |i_CTRL-R| followed by + (only works in insert mode, and doesn't solve
    copying)
  * Solutions that insert system clipboard contents one character at a time,
    such as using Ctrl-Shift-v (perhaps with 'paste' enabled)
  * System Copy: https://github.com/christoomey/vim-system-copy

This plugin is in this reference class, and makes use of the prefixes "c" and
"g" as a way to make access easier. The prefix "c" is used in normal mode and
the prefix "g" is used in visual mode (since "c" has prior meaning); you can
probably guess all or most of the mappings. In visual mode, only yanking
mappings are provided, because "gp" and "gP" have prior meaning. If you would
like to override the default meanings for "gp" and "gP", the following is one
way to do so: >

  vnoremap <expr> gp v:register !=# '"' ? '"' . v:register . 'gp' : '"+p'
  vnoremap ""gp gp
  vnoremap <expr> gP v:register !=# '"' ? '"' . v:register . 'gP' : '"+P'
  vnoremap ""gP gP
<

This will access quoteplus when no register is prefixed, but will revert to
the default meaning when a register is given, such as when typing `"xgp`.
