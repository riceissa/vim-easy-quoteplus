*easy-quoteplus*  Easier access to |quoteplus|

INTRODUCTION                                    *easy-quoteplus*

Vim's |quoteplus| register, which stores the contents of the system clipboard,
is somewhat tedious to access by default. As a result there have been various
approaches to make access easier:

  * CUA keybindings with, e.g. |mswin.vim|
  * |clipboard-unnamedplus| to make |quoteplus| the default register for yank,
    delete, change, and put commands
  * Various |<Leader>| mappings
  * |i_CTRL-R| followed by + (only works in insert mode, and doesn't solve
    copying)
  * Solutions that insert system clipboard contents one character at a time,
    such as using Ctrl-Shift-v (perhaps with 'paste' enabled)
  * System Copy: https://github.com/christoomey/vim-system-copy

This plugin is in this reference class, and makes use of the prefixes "c" and
"g" as a way to make access easier. The prefix "c" is used in normal mode and
the prefix "g" is used in visual mode; you can probably guess all or most of
the mappings.
