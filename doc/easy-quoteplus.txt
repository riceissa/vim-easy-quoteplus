*easy-quoteplus*  Easier access to |quoteplus|

INTRODUCTION                                    *easy-quoteplus*

Vim's |quoteplus| register, which stores the contents of the system clipboard,
is somewhat tedious to access by default. As a result there have been various
approaches to make access easier:

  * CUA keybindings with, e.g. |mswin.vim|
  * |clipboard-unnamedplus| to make |quoteplus| the default register for yank,
    delete, change, and put commands
  * Various |<Leader>| mappings
  * |i_CTRL-R| followed by + (only works in insert mode, and doesn't solve
    copying)
  * Solutions that insert system clipboard contents one character at a time,
    such as using Ctrl-Shift-v (perhaps with 'paste' enabled)
  * System Copy: https://github.com/christoomey/vim-system-copy

This plugin is in this reference class, and makes use of the prefixes "c" and
"g" as a way to make access easier. The prefix "c" is used in normal mode and
the prefix "g" is used in visual mode; you can probably guess all or most of
the mappings.

The only mappings from default Vim that this plugin overrides are gp and gP in
visual mode. However, even as this plugin overrides those mappings, it tries to
do so somewhat delicately. The table below may be helpful.

To get in visual mode		Type		Mapping same as original?
"+p				gp		No
gp				1gp		No
"+gp				"+gp		Yes
"ap				"ap		Yes
"agp				"agp		Yes
5"+p				5gp		No
5gp				5p`]<Space>	No
5"+gp				5"+gp		Yes
5"ap				5"ap		Yes
5"agp				5"agp		Yes

If you have a timeout for custom mappings, you can also type what you want but
wait after the "g" in rows that have a "g" in the left column.
